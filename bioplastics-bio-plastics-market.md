<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioplastics (Bio-plastics） Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biodegradable</li><li>Non-biodegradable/Bio-based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bioplastics are sustainable materials derived from biological sources such as plants, starch, or microorganisms. The market is divided into two main types: biodegradable and non-biodegradable. Biodegradable bioplastics break down naturally through microbial action, making them environmentally friendly options for applications like packaging and single-use items. Non-biodegradable bioplastics, while derived from renewable resources, do not decompose easily and can persist in the environment. Both types contribute to reducing reliance on petroleum-based plastics and promote a circular economy in material use.</p></p>
