<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wheel Flange Lubrication System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SolidStickSystem</li><li>SpraySystem</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Wheel Flange Lubrication System market encompasses two primary types: Solid Stick Systems and Spray Systems. Solid Stick Systems use lubricating sticks or bars that are positioned on the track to provide continuous lubrication to the wheel flanges as the train passes, reducing friction and wear. In contrast, Spray Systems utilize nozzles to apply a fine mist of lubricant directly onto the wheel flanges, which offers more precise and adjustable lubrication. Both systems aim to enhance operational efficiency and extend equipment lifespan in railway applications.</p></p>
