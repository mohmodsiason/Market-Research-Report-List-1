<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disinfection Sprayer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrostatic</li><li>Non-Electrostatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The disinfection sprayer market is primarily divided into two types: electrostatic and non-electrostatic sprayers. Electrostatic sprayers utilize a charged mechanism to ensure that disinfectant droplets evenly coat surfaces, effectively reaching difficult areas. They enhance coverage and efficiency in disinfection processes. Non-electrostatic sprayers, on the other hand, operate without electrical charges, relying on traditional spray mechanisms. While they can still be effective, they may require more manual effort to achieve uniform coverage and may not provide the same level of efficiency as their electrostatic counterparts.</p></p>
