<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pain Management RF Lesion Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Radio Frequency (RF)</li><li>Pulsed Radio Frequency (PRF)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pain Management RF Lesion Generator market consists of two primary types: Conventional Radio Frequency (RF) and Pulsed Radio Frequency (PRF). Conventional RF uses continuous electrical energy to create thermal lesions, effectively disrupting pain signals at nerve fibers. In contrast, PRF operates at lower temperatures and delivers short bursts of energy, promoting tissue healing while minimizing nerve damage. Both techniques are utilized in managing chronic pain conditions, offering varying benefits depending on the treatment goals and patient needs.</p></p>
