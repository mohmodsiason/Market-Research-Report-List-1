<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inductive Encoder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incremental</li><li>Absolute</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inductive encoders are categorized into two main market types: Incremental and Absolute. Incremental encoders provide relative position changes by generating pulses as the shaft rotates, requiring a reference point for accurate positioning. They are commonly used in applications needing speed detection. In contrast, Absolute encoders deliver a unique position value for each shaft angle, ensuring precise location data without the need for a reference point. Their reliability makes them ideal for applications requiring absolute position tracking, like robotics and automation.</p></p>
